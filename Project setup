Welcome to Vtasks, a productivity web app for scheduling your tasks now and for the future.

Setup process
The app use Mysql as its database due to its simplicity to use and integrate

In violetproject/violetproject/settings.py:
1. Install mysql and configure as follows:
    a. Create a database named vtasks'.
    b. create a user 'violet' and give them all privileges over the database.
    c. The password for the user should be fOGC@4201 or any that you wish as long as you ensure consistency with settings.py file configs.

Later in the settings.py

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'vtasks',
        'USER': 'violet',
        'PASSWORD': 'fOGC@4201',
        'HOST': 'localhost',  # Or the database server's IP address
